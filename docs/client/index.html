<h2>About This Repository</h2>
<p>Use this GitHub repository for managing the development of your AppEng coursework.
At the formative and summative deadlines, we will use the contents of the repository to give you feedback and to assess your work.
Push your local copy regularly (and when it's time for submission).</p>
<h2>The Task</h2>
<p>Everything you have to do is in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KNq3Px8Tb8jbYcLfJLNOJRX8RtqPapvV4_B6vzDoJCc">Coursework Spec</a>.</p>
<h1>Submissions</h1>
<h2>Formative Submission</h2>
<p>Design documentation files can be found in the <a href="docs/formative-submission">docs/formative-submission</a> folder and the pre-recorded video can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/W0rBenLF7PI">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Final Submission</h2>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<h3>Formative Submission Redesign</h3>
<p>After the formative submission, I decided to redo the design and plan for the
system. The initial design was a more open approach that allowed users to upload
work, give it a topic and let others review work from specific topics. However I
didn't feel this reflected what the specification was asking for, as the system
was meant to be directed towards university students. So I decided to redesign
the system, opting to include classes and assignments and have where users
review their peer's work within each assignment. The docs for the redesign can
be found <a href="/tree/2c09f951b369c04e0126d89c4641b882631aec21/docs">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Initial Design and Final Design Differences</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, when initially designing the system, I overestimated the scope of
the project. I did not take into account the fact I was using TypeScript for
the first time and I was going to be attempt unit testing for the second
time. These of course took time to learn that I did not factor for. As a result
I had to cut some major features from the project, which were the class
teachers, statistical reviews (custom review questions) and viewing of other
user profiles. However, the project still meets the requirements set by the
specification.</p>
<p>The initial API design did not differ largely from the final API, but the final
API does include many more paths. The major differences are that the
<code>/users/{uuid}/work</code>, <code>/users/{uuid}/reviews</code>, <code>/user/{uuid}/work</code> and
<code>/user/{uuid}/reviews</code> paths are not present in the final API. The <code>/user</code> path
is renamed to <code>/me</code> and finally, the paths that include
<code>/class/{class}/assignments/{assignment}/work</code> now only use <code>/work</code> to reduce
the maximum nesting depth. There were more less significant changes to the API.</p>
<h3>Development Experience</h3>
<h4>TypeScript</h4>
<p>When I initially started using TypeScript on the project, I did not enjoy it. It
was difficult to set up and I felt overwhelmed by the amount of type defining I
needed to do. However, as I got better at using it, learnt more efficient
methods and used type inference where possible, I enjoyed it a lot more. I still
feel that it is difficult to set up, but I think that may get easier the more I
use it and the more it is supported. I found it incredibly helpful when
programming and I will definitely use it in future projects.</p>
<p>I chose to use TypeScript only on the server and use plain JavaScript on the
client as I felt using it on the client may be too time-consuming due to the
volatile nature of DOM interaction. I think this was a great choice, I feel
using TypeScript on the client would be too much effort for too little gain
and due to me overestimating scope, I would have needed to cut more features. I
feel it would be useful with client frameworks, but for DOM interaction I think
it will be too heavy-handed. My opinion may change in the future as I have yet
to actually use TypeScript on the client.</p>
<h4>Unit Testing</h4>
<p>Unit testing the largest downfall in the project. I spent too much time trying
to smartly develop a system to dynamically generate mock data. Which in
hindsight, should not have been implemented and I should have instead manually
tested specific values already inserted into the test database. As a result of
this, I stopped unit tests early on in development as it was taking too much
time to create tests and was becoming too complex.</p>
<h4>Web Components</h4>
<p>This was my first time using web components on the client and they were
incredibly useful. I set the html for the web component within the JavaScript
by creating a template element and setting it's innerHTML, this was great as
it provided a fully modularised component. I found web components took away a
lot of duplicate code and gave more opportunities to be creative with the DOM,
which was brilliant. I will be using web components in my future projects and
have already started implementing them in some ongoing ones.</p>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>I used JSDoc, TypeDoc, Swagger and Madge for my documentation. JSDoc and TypeDoc
were incredibly useful during development as I could add descriptions to my code
that would be picked up and shown to me using VS Code's IntelliSense. However,
I did not use the generated docs nearly at all, but I feel this is because I
was already getting the benefit through IntelliSense. Swagger was remarkable, I
spent a large portion of my time during development in the swagger interface
testing my API and checking my API and it has saved a significant amount of
project development hours. Madge was also brilliant for easily generating
a simple module diagram that allowed me to visualise the system's modules better
and spot any circular dependencies. I will certainly be using all of these
documentation methods in the future.</p>
<h4>File Structure</h4>
<p>The folder-by-feature structure I chose was good and didn't cause any issues
during development. However I'm not entirely happy with it, I think it could be
improved by including sub-folders for each component layer, such as /api,
/services and /db, which would allow for better and more modularisation.</p>
<h4>Resource Naming</h4>
<p>Finally, I feel that my resources could have been named better. I didn't give
this a large amount of thought initially and it was too late in development
to implement new resource names. I think renaming classes to cohorts would
better suit it's role and also stop issues with class being a reserved keyword.
I would also rename work to submissions as the ambiguity of work being both
singular and plural is not great for RESTful API paths and programming.</p></article>
